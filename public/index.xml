      <description>FUN WITH RETICULATE:
The reticulate package lets R and Python work together! I tested this out with a few codes below. Continue reading for a more detailed explanation on how this works.
library(reticulate) Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON=&amp;quot;/usr/bin/python&amp;quot;) use_python(&amp;quot;/usr/bin/python&amp;quot;) #Python code chunk x=&amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot; y=&amp;quot;Abracadabra&amp;quot; print(&amp;quot;R and Python are cool!&amp;quot;) ## R and Python are cool! #R code chunk library(reticulate) py$x ## [1] &amp;quot;Magic&amp;quot; py$y ## [1] &amp;quot;Abracadabra&amp;quot; You can assign something to an R code chunk like “hello“ and save it as “hi” then in python you can also assign something like “world” and also save it as “hi”.</description>

      <description>Introduction The two datasets that I have chosen to use for my analysis are Temp_increase_1850_2018_and co2_concentration_1850_2018_. These two datasets contain information on global temperature increase and global Co2 emissions. The first dataset looks into global temperature increase from 1850-2017. The second dataset looks into global Co2 emissions as well as emissions from some of the world’s largest producers, the US and China from the years 1850-2017. I chose these datasets because I was interested in seeing the relationship between carbon emissions both globally and from the biggest producers and the way it correlates with global temperature increase.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 5/1/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
